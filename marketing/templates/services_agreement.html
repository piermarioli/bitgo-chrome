Payment for covered losses as a loss payee are conditioned upon and limited by the determinations of the Policy underwriter, the terms and definitions set forth in the Policy, the term of the Policy (which is not guaranteed to last the entire period that you use the Services), and the terms and requirements described in the Loss Protection and Procedures.  Our Policy may terminate in accordance with its terms, and without notice to our customers.  Further, you will not be eligible as loss payee if the loss was caused by or the result of your negligence, your intentional misconduct, or your actions or failures to act that constitute a breach of this Agreement.
